```html
<div style="background-image: linear-gradient(to right, #6366F1, #805AD5); padding: 4px; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0px 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);">
  <!-- Content -->
</div>
```
This solution uses inline CSS with a linear gradient. This offers more explicit control over gradient direction and colors, often leading to consistent rendering across different browsers. You should still investigate why your original Tailwind CSS wasn't working.  This could be due to a missing plugin, an incorrect version, or a conflicting class.
