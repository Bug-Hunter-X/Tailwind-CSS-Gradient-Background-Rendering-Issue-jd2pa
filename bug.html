```html
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <!-- Content -->
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind CSS classes to create a gradient background. However, the gradient might not render correctly in some browsers or versions of Tailwind CSS due to issues with browser compatibility or plugin conflicts.  The `bg-gradient-to-r` class specifically may be causing unexpected behavior.
