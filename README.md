# Tailwind CSS Gradient Background Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug where a Tailwind CSS gradient background may not render correctly in all browsers. The issue appears to be related to the `bg-gradient-to-r` utility class and may stem from browser compatibility issues or conflicts with other installed plugins.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in your browser.
3. Observe that the gradient background might not display correctly or display as expected depending on the browser and setup. 

## Solution

The solution file, `bugSolution.html`, provides a workaround by using fallback colors and CSS linear-gradient instead.
